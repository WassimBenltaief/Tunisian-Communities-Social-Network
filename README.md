Tunisian-Communities-Social-Network
===================================

A project with a purpose to group Tunisian communities and deliver their events to the interested people in order to spread the information in a more efficient way.


The mission statement above could use some work. 

Basically we need to make a place where people would sign-up to communities that they're interested in and then get updates from
these communities.


- First of all we need to manage to decompose this project to small parts. Each part can be done in a single sprint of 6 working hours (some hackathons maybe)
- Second we need to make a decision about the technologies that will run the engine of this social network (languages, frameworks, design patterns..)
- Decide in what way you can contribute (Design, code, integration, bug fix, apis ... ) 

- Have fun most of all, and hopefully while building a community social network, we can build our little own community of builders.
- ???

- Deploy this for alpha testing.
